# Netflix-Data-EDA-using-SQL
Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix dataset using SQL. Designed schema, cleaned data, and wrote queries to analyze trends by type, genre, country, and ratings. Applied CTEs, window &amp; string functions to uncover insights on actors, directors, and content patterns.

Project: Netflix Data Exploration & Analysis (SQL)

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset using PostgreSQL. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about Netflix‚Äôs content library, including trends by type, genre, country, rating, and more.

üîπ Key Features:

Designed and created a structured SQL database schema for Netflix titles.

Wrote optimized SQL queries to:

Count total Movies vs. TV Shows.

Identify the most common ratings for each content type.

Find the top 5 countries contributing most content.

Retrieve movies released in specific years and longest-duration movies.

List TV shows with more than 5 seasons.

Analyze genre distribution using string functions and aggregations.

Track content added in the last 5 years.

Discover top actors, directors, and country-specific contributions.

Categorize content based on keywords in descriptions (e.g., ‚Äúviolence‚Äù, ‚Äúkill‚Äù).

üîπ Tools & Skills:

SQL (PostgreSQL) ‚Äì Joins, Window Functions, String Functions, Date Functions, CTEs.

Data Exploration ‚Äì Genre analysis, trend identification, and categorization logic.

Data Cleaning ‚Äì Handling missing values (e.g., missing directors), restructuring fields.

üîπ Outcomes:

Generated insights into content production trends, actor/director dominance, and audience-oriented content categories.

Built a reusable SQL script for structured OTT content analysis.
